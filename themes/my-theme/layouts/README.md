# README

This is where all of the layout templates for your project live. Templates for "custom content types" go in their own directory, who's name should match the name of the directory in the `content` folder of your main Hugo directory.

For example, if you have a `content/articles` directory, those items will automatically have the "articles" type. Templates for them should live in the `articles` directory here.

Any content type without a template directory will use the `_defaults` layouts.
